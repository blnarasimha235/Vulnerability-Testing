I.	 INTRODUCTION

A.	Background and significance of website vulnerability scanning

Because of the increasing number of individuals using the internet, website security has become an important issue for businesses of all kinds. Breach of website security may result in the loss of data, financial loss, and harm to the organization's reputation, and even legal consequences for the business. The process of locating weak points in a website's code, configuration, and network architecture is known as vulnerability scanning, and it is one of the most important aspects of website security.
When it comes to proactively identifying and mitigating security issues, website owners and administrators cannot do without the indispensable tool that is website vulnerability screening. Web applications, network devices, and servers are all able to be scanned by vulnerability scanners so that any known flaws may be found and remedied. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are two examples of industry and regulatory security requirements that may be easier to meet for organizations that utilise vulnerability scanners. 

B.	Purpose and objectives of the study

This study's objective is to determine how successful various website vulnerability scanning technologies are in locating security flaws and flaws in their identification processes. The following are some of the goals of the study:

To determine which website vulnerability scanning technologies are used most often.

To determine how successful these tools are in finding vulnerabilities and to assess their performance.

To evaluate the efficacy of various scanning techniques by contrasting the findings they provide and looking for major discrepancies between them.

To investigate the restrictions imposed by vulnerability scanning tools and identify places where they may be improved.

C.	Scope and limitations of the study

The evaluation of the efficiency of website vulnerability scanning technologies in locating security flaws is the only thing that will be covered in this research. The usefulness of additional website security features such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access restrictions is not investigated in this research. The research does not analyses the usefulness of manual security testing or any of the other types of security evaluations.

The availability of vulnerability testing tools, as well as the amount of time and resources needed to carry out a complete examination of each tool, are two of the factors that contribute to the limits of this research. In addition, the outcomes of the research might be influenced by the particular settings of the websites that were put to the test as well as the expertise level of the personnel who carried out the evaluations.

D.	Definition of terms

1)	Vulnerability scanning: Scanning for vulnerabilities is the process of finding flaws in a website's code, configuration, and network architecture by making use of automated technologies.
2)	Website security: Website security refers to the process of protecting websites and online applications from being accessed, used, modified, or destroyed without authorization.

3)	Vulnerability: A vulnerability is a weakness or fault in the code, configuration, or network architecture of a website that may be exploited by attackers to obtain unauthorized access or threaten the website's integrity or availability. Vulnerabilities can be found in all three of these areas.

4)	Scanning tool: A scanning tool is a piece of software that searches for known vulnerabilities in the code, configuration, or network architecture of a website. This helps to automate the process of vulnerability scanning, which is otherwise a manual procedure.

II.	METHODOLOGY

A.	Research design and approach
In order to evaluate the efficiency of website vulnerability screening technologies, this study used a quantitative research approach. The strategy involves using automated scanning technologies in order to locate and classify vulnerabilities that are present in the website that is the target of the attack. Securityscan.getastra, Pentest-tools, and site-lock were the scanners that were used for this particular research project. The findings collected from each tool are compared in this research so that an accurate assessment of each one's ability to spot vulnerabilities can be made.
B.	Data collection methods and tools

The information required for this research was obtained by a vulnerability scan on a website using the three tools described earlier in above section. The website that will serve as the focus of our investigation is an e-commerce and other fields platform of moderate scale that has a checkered past in terms of data protection. The website in question was analyzed by making use of the aforementioned three instruments, and the findings were recorded and arranged according to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scale.

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a standardized framework that is used to evaluate the degree to which vulnerabilities are present in a system. When determining the level of danger posed by a vulnerability, the framework assigns each vulnerability a number between 0 and 10, with higher scores indicating a greater level of danger. The score method takes into consideration the target system's access vector, access complexity, authentication, secrecy, and integrity. It also takes into account whether or not the system is available.


C.	Data analysis techniques

Descriptive analysis is used in order to do analysis on the data gathered during the process of vulnerability screening. In order to offer a clear understanding of the vulnerabilities that were found in the target website, the findings were presented in the form of tables and figures. The research also used a comparative analysis methodology to assess the efficacy of the three tools in detecting and classifying vulnerabilities. This was done as part of the study as shown in Table 1.

As part of the comparison study, we compare both the total number of vulnerabilities found by each tool and the degree to which those flaws affected the system. The accuracy of each diagnostic instrument is also assessed, both in terms of its ability to detect false positives and false negatives.

This research comprises not only a quantitative analysis but also a qualitative analysis of the findings gained from the process of vulnerability scanning in addition to the quantitative analysis. Within the context of the qualitative analysis, a discussion of the results and their repercussions for website security will take place. The results of the vulnerability scanning procedure are used as the basis for the research's suggestions for enhancing website security. These recommendations are based on the findings of the study.


III.	ANALYSIS
A.	Overview of Website Vulnerability Scanning

The process of finding security flaws or vulnerabilities in a website's architecture, design, and content is referred to as website vulnerability scanning. Utilizing specialized software and methods, the code, configuration, and network architecture of a website are analyzed in order to locate any possible vulnerabilities in the site's security. The main goal of website vulnerability scanning is to detect holes that may be exploited by hackers or other malicious actors to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive information or disrupt website operations. This can be accomplished by analyzing how a website is built and how it interacts with its users.

B.	Common website vulnerabilities

The type and severity of website vulnerabilities may be used to categories the vulnerabilities into a variety of distinct categories. The following are some of the most frequent vulnerabilities that may affect websites:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a kind of vulnerability that enables attackers to inject malicious code into the HTML or JavaScript code of a website. This code may then be executed by users who visit the site without being aware that they are being targeted in this way.

SQL Injection is a vulnerability that gives attackers the ability to run arbitrary SQL commands on the backend database of a website, which may lead to the theft of data or the alteration of data.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a vulnerability that gives attackers the ability to fake HTTP requests so that they seem to originate from a valid user. This enables the attacker to fool the server into carrying out operations that are not authorized by the server.

File Inclusion Vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that enable attackers to add harmful files in the code of a website. These files may then be executed by users that visit the website.
C.	Types of website vulnerability scanners

There are several varieties of website vulnerability scanners on sale today, including the following:

Scanners that analyse a website's network architecture and infrastructure are called network scanners. These scanners look for possible security risks by analysing a website's network.

Web Application Scanners These scanners do an analysis of the code and content of a website in order to locate possible security flaws.

Host-based Scanners These scanners do an analysis of the software and operating system of a website in order to locate any possible security flaws.
D.	Factors to consider in choosing a website vulnerability scanner

When choosing a website vulnerability scanner, some of the factors to consider include:

Type of scanner – Different types of scanners may be more effective in identifying certain types of vulnerabilities.

Accuracy – The scanner should be able to accurately identify vulnerabilities without generating false positives.

Ease of use – The scanner should be user-friendly and easy to use.

Integration – The scanner should be able to integrate with other security tools and systems.
E.	Results of website vulnerability scanning

The findings of website vulnerability scanning may be somewhat variable depending on the kind of scanner that was used, the complexity of the website, and the degree to which any vulnerabilities that were found were exploitable. The findings are often delivered in the form of a report that details the vulnerabilities that were found, the severity level associated with each vulnerability, and the suggested measures for its remedy. Scanning a website for vulnerabilities is not a one-time action, but rather an ongoing process that should be conducted periodically to ensure that the website stays safe against new threats. It is crucial to keep in mind that this is not a one-time activity, but rather a process that should be performed regularly.

IV.	CONCLUSION
It is clear, based on the vulnerability scanning of websites that were carried out, that various websites have varied degrees of risk and different percentages of vulnerability. The findings of the scans that were performed on the websites' levels of vulnerability revealed that some websites had a larger vulnerability percentage than others. Nerdwallet.com, for instance, was determined to have a high vulnerability percentage of 75%, which indicates that the website poses a significant risk. On the other hand, it was discovered that websites such as bloomberg.com and investopedia.com had a lower risk level with vulnerability percentages of 10% and 20%, respectively. It was discovered that the websites shopify.com and turnitin.com each had a vulnerability percentage of 20% and 22%, respectively, which corresponded to a medium risk level.

The research offers a summary of website vulnerability scanning, frequent website vulnerabilities, the different kinds of website vulnerability scanners, and the aspects that should be taken into consideration when selecting a website vulnerability scanner. In addition to that, the report provides a detailed walkthrough of the website vulnerability screening process.

In conclusion, website vulnerability scanning is an important activity that must be completed in order to find and resolve vulnerabilities in websites. The research highlights how important it is to do frequent scans of websites for vulnerabilities in order to ward off assaults and preserve user data. The results of the research indicate that website vulnerability scanning may give website owners with helpful information about the security of their websites and assist them in taking suitable steps to reduce risks.
